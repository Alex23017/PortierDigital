        Think of it this way: There are two kinds of failure. The first comes from never trying out
        your ideas because you are afraid, or because you are waiting for the perfect time. This
        kind of failure you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you. The second
        kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="template__body-text">
        If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation is greatly outweighed by
        what you learn. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity
        how things must be done.

        In the future, the great division will be between those who have trained themselves to
        handle these complexities and those who are overwhelmed by them -- those who can acquire
        skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media
        around them and can enver focus enough to learn.

        We are all in search of feeling more connected to realityâ€”to other people, the times we live
        in, the natural world, our character, and our own uniqueness. Our culture increasingly tends
        to separate us from these realities in various ways.

        We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or risky behavior, just to
        wake ourselves up from the sleep of our daily existence and feel a heightened sense of
        connection to reality. In the end, however, the most satisfying and powerful way to feel
        this connection is through creative activity.
      </p>
      <p class="template__body-text">
        Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever, because we are making
        something and not merely consuming, Masters of the small reality we create. In doing this
        work, we are in fact creating ourselves.
